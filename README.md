**[ALL CODE SO FAR WRITTEN AND COMPILED BY OPEN-AI]**

PicoBoost is a small but powerful boost controller for automotive enthusiasts. This Git project is focused on delivering the picoboost.py script initially, a key component of the PicoBoost experience.

With the picoboost script, users will be able to fine-tune their boost control with precision and accuracy. The script reads potentiometer values and button states to provide real-time feedback on boost status. The RGB LED also provides visual feedback on the status of the rolling anti-lag feature.

Join the PicoBoost community today and help discover a new form of precision simulation boost control!

TODO:

• Add functionality to interface with Assetto Corsa

• Add 5 second "boost building" function when KERS button is pressed (LED changes red and blinks for 5 seconds then turns solid green until KERS button is released, then return to original loop)

• Add better smoothing to stop potentiometer readings jumping around

• Have the data shown in Thonny shell on a 16x2 LCD Screen
